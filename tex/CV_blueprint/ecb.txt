    Data analysis tools:
    - Created, by myself and from the ground up, a new "Discovery Dashboard" using Plotly Dash which halves the time needed for monthly and quarterly data production, as well as enabling easier and in-depth data analysis. I am now working to create a second dashboard for the analysis of euro-area data. The project has been highly praised and brought as an example in front of the whole Directorate, with direct praise from the Director General
    - Developed many new data analysis and visualization tools for the team, mostly in Jupyter, many of which now constitute the basis of the BoP data analysis process in the new platform SPACE
    - Update and Maintenance of the Quality Assurance Report for BoP, in RMarkdown, which is sent to NCBs during each production round

    Python:
    - Migration to the new statistical platform SPACE (including writing new code to implement business-relevant changes, extensions and fixes)
    - Creation and maintenance of automated CI/CD checks to automatically scan for new show-stopper bugs in the BoP SPACE processes
    - Testing if new functionality satisfies the stated requirements
    - Documentation of the new SPACE processes

    Micro-data:
    - Collecting information on SPEs Portfolio Investment from micro-data in RIAD and SHSS databases, using SQL, to produce new euro area macro estimates. Work on this project could also lead to a short publication

    Balance of Payments:
    - Working on periodic data production rounds for balance of payment statistics, running validations, analysing outliers and interacting with NCBs to understand and fix major issues in the data, as well as running the business-critical compilation of the data for the euro area to be published in the ECB Data Portal
    - Periodic meetings with NCBs on quarterly asymmetries resolution in foreign direct investment, preparing the documents needed and writing minutesExternal Statistics and Sectors Accounts Division - External Statistics Section Data analysis tools: - Created, by myself and from the ground up, a new "Discovery Dashboard" using Plotly Dash which halves the time needed for monthly and quarterly data production, as well as enabling easier and in-depth data analysis.

    - Migration of external debt calculations for euro area balance of payments
    - Migration of the processs covering seasonal adjustment of euro area current account timeseries
