PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

European Central Bank -Research Analyst September 2022 - August 2024 (end of contract, could not be renewed because of internal rules)

    External Statistics and Sectors Accounts Division - External Statistics Section

    Data analysis tools:
    - Created, by myself and from the ground up, a new "Discovery Dashboard" using Plotly Dash (python) which halves the time needed for monthly and quarterly data production, as well as enabling easier and in-depth data analysis. I am now working to create a second dashboard for the analysis of euro-area data
    - Developed many new data analysis and visualization tools for the team, mostly in Jupyter, many of which now constitute the basis of the BoP data analysis process in the new platform SPACE
    - Update and Maintenance of the Quality Assurance Report for BoP, in RMarkdown, which is sent to NCBs during each production round

    Python:
    - Migration to the new statistical platform SPACE (including writing new code to implement business-relevant changes, extensions and fixes)
    - Creation and maintenance of automated CI/CD checks to automatically scan for new show-stopper bugs in the BoP SPACE processes
    - Testing if new functionality satisfies the stated requirements
    - Documentation of the new SPACE processes

    Micro-data:
    - Collecting information on SPEs Portfolio Investment from micro-data in RIAD and SHSS databases, using SQL, to produce new euro area macro estimates. Work on this project could also lead to a short publication

    Balance of Payments:
    - Working on periodic data production rounds for balance of payment statistics, running validations, analysing outliers and interacting with NCBs to understand and fix major issues in the data, as well as running the business-critical compilation of the data for the euro area to be published in the ECB Data Portal
    - Periodic meetings with NCBs on quarterly asymmetries resolution in foreign direct investment, preparing the documents needed and writing minutes
    - Migration of external debt calculations for euro area balance of payments
    - Migration of the processs covering seasonal adjustment of euro area current account timeseries

EDUCATION

University of Cambridge
Master of Advanced Studies (MASt), Pure Mathematics · (2017 - 2018)
    Part III of the Mathematical Tripos (officially Master of Mathematics/Master of Advanced Study) is a one-year Masters-level taught course in mathematics offered at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge. 
    It is regarded as one of the hardest and most intensive mathematics courses in the world and is taken by approximately 200 students each year. Roughly one third of the students take the course as a fourth year of mathematical study at Cambridge (after Parts IA, IB, and II), whilst the remaining two thirds take the course as a one-year course. [Wikipedia]

    The university receives approximately 800 applications every year, 160 of which are admitted to the course. These students are joined by roughly 90 students who took their BA in Cambridge to make up a final Part III cohort of approximately 250 students.
Activities and societies: - Took part in the First Term Part III Seminar Series, giving a talk about a topological proof of Borsuk-Ulam on the 30th of November.
- Production Officer of the Wolfson May Ball committee, personally responsible of a budget of £ 12'000, out of a total £ 65'000. 
- Wolfson College IT Strategy Committee student representative.
